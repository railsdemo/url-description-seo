##URL Description (Search Engine Optimization) Demo

[Heroku Demo Link](http://url-description-seo.herokuapp.com/)

A demo of URLs that follows these guidelines:

1. **Numeric IDs** are used to identify resources
2. **Descriptions** are appended to the path for Search Engine Optimization
3. **Spaces** are replaced with '_' instead of ascii encoded value '%20'

To demo this, a location object is used with attributes ID, Name, and Type.  The description will follow the format:  < Name > (< Type >)
